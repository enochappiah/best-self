## Identify one area of growth as a leader/teammate.

Interviewee 2: Jade Boateng-Moore is my best friend and girlfriend. She is a Medicine, Science, and the Humanities Pre-Med Major and President of the Knotty By Nature club here at Hopkins. I chose her because we have known each other since the beginning of freshman year and has been there for my highest highs and lowest lows and would have a great perspective on times where I was my best self.
